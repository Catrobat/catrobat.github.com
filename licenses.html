        <h2>Licenses of the Catrobat system</h2><br />
        <strong>The following licenses, terms, and conditions apply to your use of the Catrobat system:</strong>
          <br />Version 2.2, 12 October 2012</p>

<p>All software constituting the Catrobat system, e.g., the Catroid Integrated Development Environment (with all associated parts such as the Tutorial), the Catroid Interpreter, Paintroid, the software we wrote to run the Catrobat websites and other Internet resources, and all our own source code related to the Catrobat system, are <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank">free software</a>: you can redistribute them and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/" target="_blank">Free Software Foundation</a>, either <a href="http://developer.catrobat.org/agpl_v3">version 3 of the License</a>, or (at your option) any <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html" target="_blank">later version when it becomes available</a>.

<p>The names and logos of the Catrobat subprojects are copyrighted by and trademarks of the Catrobat project and cannot be used in derivative work. You are however allowed to use the names and logos of Catrobat, Catroid, Paintroid and Kittyroid in non-derivative work such as, e.g., books, brochures, or descriptive web pages. We do ask to include a note that either says <em>"Catrobat is developed by the Catrobat project <a href="http://developer.catrobat.org/">http://developer.catrobat.org/</a>"</em> or <em>"Catrobat makes it easy to program your own interactive stories, games, and animations --- and share your creations on the web. As you create and share Catrobat programs, you learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. All parts of the Catrobat system are developed by the Catrobat project. They are available as free open source software from <a href="http://developer.catrobat.org/">http://developer.catrobat.org/</a>"</em>.

<p>For the parts of the Catrobat system necessary for running a Catrobat program, e.g., the Catroid Interpreter, the GNU Affero General Public License is supplemented by an <a href="http://developer.catrobat.org/license_additional_term">additional permission under section 7 of version 3 of the License</a>. This exception allows you to convey a runtime version of a Catrobat program, for which you otherwise legally hold the necessary rights, in combination with the parts of the Catrobat system necessary for running that Catrobat program, under terms of <em>your</em> choice, consistent with the licensing of the independent parts of the corresponding Catrobat program. 

<p>Please note that this is only possible either when you are the sole creator of the program including all its parts such as graphics, texts, sounds, etc, or in case you licensed the parts of other programs on which your program is based upon, including any additional material and/or possible trademarks etc, in such a way that you are allowed to convey the resulting software under your chosen terms in consistence with these third-party materials. This additional permission is similar to the additional permission for GCC (see the corresponding <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception-faq.html" target="_blank"> Rationale and FAQ page for the exception for GCC </a> for more information). If the work thus created has an interactive user interface, it must display a note in a screen shown when the user presses an "About" menu button or a similar way to convey such a message that says "This work was created using programs developed by the Catrobat project. Catrobat makes it easy to program your own interactive stories, games, and animations --- and share your creations on the web. As you create and share programs with Catrobat, you learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Catrobat is available as free open source software from <a href="http://developer.catrobat.org/">http://developer.catrobat.org/</a> and is distributed by the Catrobat project under the GNU Affero GNU Affero General Public License as published by the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/" target="_blank">Free Software Foundation</a>, either <a href="http://developer.catrobat.org/agpl3">version 3 of the License</a>, or (at your option) any <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html" target="_blank">later version when it becomes available</a>. For the parts of the Catrobat system necessary for running a Catrobat program, e.g., the Catrobat Interpreter, the GNU Affero General Public License is supplemented by an additional permission under section 7 of <a href="http://catroid.org/catroid/agpl3standalone">version 3 of the License</a>. This exception allows to convey a runtime version of a Catroid program, for which you otherwise legally hold the necessary rights, in combination with the parts of the Catroid system necessary for running that Catrobat program, under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the independent parts of the corresponding Catrobat program.". The same notice must also be added by you as text in or along any documents you distribute together with your runtime version of the program. Please consult our <a href="http://developer.catrobat.org/license_additional_term">Catrobat License Additional Term page</a> for the precise legal formulation of the additional permission under section 7 of version 3 of the GNU Affero GNU Affero General Public License. For clarification, note that this additional permission does <em>not</em> apply to programs you upload to Catrobat's website. Please consult <a href="http://catroid.org/catroid/termsofuse">http://catroid.org/catroid/termsofuse</a> for the terms and <a href="http://catroid.org/catroid/licenseofuploadedprojects">http://catroid.org/catroid/licenseofuploadedprojects</a> for the precise legal terms and conditions that apply to a project you upload to Catrobat's website.

<p>All non-software artifacts of the Catrobat system created by us, such as, e.g., text, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features, and other materials are available under the <a href="http://developer.catrobat.org/ccbysa_v3">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License</a>, the only exceptions being the names and logos of the Catrobat project (including, e.g., Catroid, Paintroid, and Kittyroid), which are trademarks of the Catrobat project and cannot be used in derivative work.
