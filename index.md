## Welcome to the developers website of the Catrobat project!

Catrobat is a visual programming language and set of creativity tools.

Through Catrobat, we promote computational thinking skills and the free/libre and open-source software philosophy in a fun and engaging way worldwide.

Catrobat and the software developed by the Catrobat team are inspired by the Scratch programming system developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. Catrobat is an independent free/libre open-source software (FOSS/FLOSS) non-profit project.

Pocket Code allows the creation and executes Catrobat programs on Android and iOS smartphones.

Catrobat programs written or Catrobat projects created on one platform can be directly run on all other platforms as well. Interested people can share catrobat projects via our [sharing site]. Uploaded Catrobat programs are AGPLed to allow free learning, remixing, and sharing.

We strive to develop our software in an uncompromising Test-Driven way (even for the hardware parts). We are using agile methods such as Ping-Pong-Pair-Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Integration, Robert C. Martinâ€™s Clean Code method and several others such as Simple Design, aiming to ensure a precise, believably correct, and 100% up-to-date documentation as well as high-quality code. We use specification by example (also called Behaviour Driven Development) to some extent to ensure that the natively implemented interpreters execute Catrobat programs in the same way on all supported platforms.
