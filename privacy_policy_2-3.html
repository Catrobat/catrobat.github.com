	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	
	<p>To offer you all the benefits of our services and the associated account, it is necessary to collect certain data from you.</p>
	  <ul>	  
		  <li>To maintain and improve our services (apps and websites) and to do scientific research on ICT and STEM/STEAM education, we use Google Analytics, Crashlytics, and Firebase, all by Google LLC (USA), to get metadata about the usage of our services, e.g., crash information, timestamps, visited pages/screens, usage of our apps and services, used operating system, and information about the network provider. This analysis and the collected data is not linked to your profile and does not contain any personal information (last bits of the IP address get anonymized). However, the collected data will get transferred to the service-provider (Google LLC, USA). Data processing is based on an agreement with Google LLC. This relationship to the service provider conforms to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) and EU-USA "Privacy Shield" agreement.</li>
		  
		  <li>To create and use an account in our systems, and to inform you about necessary changes about your account per e-mail, e.g., updates or violations of our <a href="https://www.catrob.at/touas">Terms of Use and Service</a>, our <a href="https://www.catrob.at/tou">community rules</a>, or our policies, we will store your username and, if provided by you, your e-mail address. If you have connected your account via Google Plus or Facebook, we additionally store an identification key connected to your account on these services. We will not use this data for any other (e.g., marketing) purposes, unless you explicitly allowed us to do so.</li>
		  
		  <li>On a voluntary basis, you can give us your country of residence through your account page on the sharing site. This will get displayed on your public profile and only be used for statistical and research purposes by us. It can be removed at any time in your profile settings.</li>
		   
		  <li>You can withdraw the usage of the personal data belonging to your account at any time by deleting your account through your profile page on <a href="https://share.catrob.at/">https://share.catrob.at/</a>. After deleting your account you will still be able to use the provided services, but not to collaborate, e.g., through uploading programs, commenting, or liking. Also, all provided content linked to your account, e.g., uploaded programs, comments, etc., will be deleted.</li>
		  		  
		  <li>To avoid misuse of our services, e.g., through user contributed uploads or comments for illegal purposes, all user generated public data (uploads, comments) will be stored internally in a database, together with a timestamp and the used internet address. This data will not be used by or forwarded to any institutions, unless sufficiently illegal actions are reasonably suspected and officially entitled legal institutions request it based on applicable law. Each case will be thoroughly checked on an individual basis by us first.</li>
		
		  <li>You can voluntarily subscribe to the Catrobat Newsletter, on <a href="https://catrob.at/newsletter">https://catrob.at/newsletter</a> provided by us through the MailChimp service (The Rocket Science Group LLC d/b/a MailChimp, USA). You will then receive updates on the Catrobat project and its services to your provided e-mail adress. You can withdraw the newsletter at any time by using the "unsubscribe" link in the footer of every newsletter. This newsletter is provided by MailChimp with whom we do have a data-processing agreement and who committed to the EU General Data Prodection Regulation and EU-USA "Privacy Shield".
