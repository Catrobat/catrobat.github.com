        <h2>First steps into Catrobat</h2><br />
        <strong>Hi, <br />the following lines should help you with your first steps into the Catrobat project.</strong>
          <br />10 January 2015</p>

          <p>Assuming you already know <a href="http://developer.catrobat.org/">developer.catrobat.org</a> your next steps should be:

            <ol>
              <li> Write some programs using Pocket Code and Pocket Paint, upload your Catrobat programs, and 
	      check out our inspiration source, the <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch project</a>.</li>
              <li> Visit us on <a href="https://github.com/Catrobat">GitHub</a> <br />
                As you can see Catrobat is a very large project with a lot of sub-teams. So go ahead and look into them. 
		Each project should have a readme file so check that out too. There should be viable information for you in it.</li>
              <li> If you want more information, visit us our 
	      <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/116816272940643231129">Google+ 
	      Community named Catrobat</a>. If you would like to work with us, please read on.</li>
              <li> If you want to contribute to our project, please choose one of the sub-projects, you would like to work on. Once 
	      you have chosen a project, we recommend that you checkout the project and play around with it a little.</li>
              <li> Maybe you find a bug while trying out Catrobat? Awesome. Report it via GitHub. If you can’t find a bug, doesn’t 
	      matter; seems that we have done too much the right way ;)</li>
              <li> Now is the right time to check out the Issues on GitHub. First fork the project then choose an Issue you can fix --> 
	      <em>first</em> write a regression test for it, and <em>then</em> only fix it. <br/><br/>
	      We <em>strictly</em> use <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment">Test-Driven Development</a> 
	      and <a href="https://www.ufm.edu/images/0/04/Clean_Code.pdf">Clean Code</a> 
	      (by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin">Robert C. Martin</a>), 
	      so first read everything you can about these development methods. 
	      Code developed in a different style will <em>not</em> be accepted.<br/><br/></li>
              <li> You have fixed an Issue and written at least one test for it? Awesome. Ask for a review via a Pull-Request in Github.</li>
              <li> It could take time some time until you hear from us.... In the meanwhile why not choose another Issue or 
	      engage in the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/116816272940643231129"> community 
	      on Google+</a>. Try to answer questions of visitors or pose questions yourself, if you have still have some.</li>
              <li> Your Pull-Request has been accepted? Go back to 6.</li>
              <li> There are no more Issues? Can't be! Go back to 5.</li>

            </ol>
