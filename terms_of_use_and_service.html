                <h3>2. Use of Software Applications and Services</h3>
                <ol type="a">

                <h3>3. Catrobat Accounts</h3>
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>In order to access some features of the Software Applications and Services, you will have to create a Catrobat account. You may never use another's account without permission.

                </ol>
                <h3>4. General Use of the Software Applications and Services --- Permissions and Restrictions</h3>
                <p>Catrobat hereby grants or denies you permission to access and use the Software Applications and Services as set forth in these Terms of Use and Service, as follows:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>If you, or, in case you are under 13 years of age, any one of your parents or your legal guardians, in the following called the “Responsible”, have been in the past and/or still are associated at this moment with a commercial, governmental, or any other type of legal entity, here meant to also include international and/or religious organizations, as well as you yourself as a private person, but excluding whole countries, in the following called the “Entity”, that is involved in and/or responsible for dragnet type privacy violations and/or bulk or mass surveillance, independently of any legitimate or illegitimate reason whatsoever (including but not limited to reasons of national security, fighting against terrorism, following the law, and/or the “preservation of social stability”), in the following collectively called “Acts”, then you are not allowed to use and/or to access Catrobat’s Software Applications and Services. In the special case of federal, national, state, regional, tribal, and/or local governments (of countries or unions of countries, e.g., the European Union, independently of whether the country is universally recognized or not), all organizations being part of said government (its legislative branches, executive branches, judicial branches, congress, senates, houses (of representatives, of lords, etc), parliaments, courts, heads, armies, embassies, agencies (including secret, quasi-official, and/or so-called independent but associated agencies), cabinets, headquarters, corporations (including government-owned corporations as well as private regulatory corporations created by the government but independent of other entities), institutions, boards, missions, ministries, commissions, chartered organizations, government-sponsored enterprises, and/or other major named suborganizations (certain “capital-letter”-type suborganizations with their own official name, sometimes called Bureau, Office, Department, Division, Institute, and/or Services; however, normal offices of a department etc in the general common sense of the words, as well as teams called “Compartments”, are explicitly not to be included), as well as their equivalents in languages other than English) are here to be considered as separate Entities; however, all persons associated with hierarchically higher-level Entities (higher-level Entities here are meant to include all Entities that have any kind of power or responsibility over an Entity involved in and/or responsible for an Act and/or over Entities that themselves are higher-level Entities to an Entity involved in and/or responsible for an Act through a recursive associative hierarchical relation; power here is meant to also include situations where the lower-level Entity in any way operates under or must report to the higher-level Entity) and their children below 13 years of age are also not allowed to use and/or access Catrobat’s Software Applications and Services, even if the hierarchically lower-level Entity acted independently, illegally, and/or against orders or policies set forth by the higher-level Entity, and even if nobody associated with the higher-level Entity was aware of any Acts of the lower-level Entity; whereas persons associated with other Entities on the same or on a lower hierarchical level are not prohibited by these Terms of Use and Services of using and/or accessing Catrobat’s Software Applications and Services as long as they are not otherwise associated with Entities involved in and/or responsible for Acts (e.g., if a National Security Agency is involved in and/or responsible for Acts, operates under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Secretary of Defense that itself is part of the Department of Defense headed by the Secretary of Defense who is a member of the Cabinet, and you are working at this Office of the Secretary of Defense or at the Cabinet, or are yourself the Secretary of Defense, then you and your children below 13 years of age are not allowed to use and/or access Catrobat’s Software Applications and Services; however, if, again, a National Security Agency is involved in and/or responsible for Acts and operates under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the Defense Logistics Agency also operates under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Secretary of Defense but itself is not involved in and/or responsible for Acts and also is not using the results of the Acts of any other Entity, and you are working for the Defense Logistics Agency and are not otherwise associated with any other Entity involved in and/or responsible for Acts, then you and your children below 13 years of age are allowed to use and/or access Catrobat’s Software Applications and Services). Being associated here means that the Responsible either has been in the past or currently still is: working for, owning, heading, leading, managing, directing, an officer of, an official for, appointed to, employed by, an agent for, a contractor for, affiliated to, a professionally advisor for, doing volunteer work for, investing into, otherwise significantly supporting (e.g., as a member of an advisory board, or as a financial contributor to a political campaign by any amount per year worth more than the current value of the fine for the violation of this restriction as set forth below; however, merely paying taxes or voting for a political party are not to be considered as sufficiently significant), and/or (as an individual) consisting of the Entity. The involvement and/or responsibility of the Entity here includes but is not limited to, e.g., the ordering, selling, conveying, provisioning, maintaining, management, creation, and/or the intentional use of such surveillance technology, as well as any intentional weakening of security, intentional installation of backdoors, rootkits, keyloggers, or any other type of privacy violating soft- and/or hardware, that are being used for Acts, independently of whether this use is done by the Entity or a third, unrelated party, and independently of whether the Entity is forced to do so under penalty of law, voluntarily, or for whatever other reason. It is also irrelevant whether the Responsible must, for whatever reason, be associated with the Entity: if you are (or, in case you are under 13 years of age, any one of your parents or your legal guardians is) associated with an Entity involved in and/or responsible for Acts, then you and your children below 13 years of age are not allowed to use and/or to access Catrobat’s Software Applications and Services. Violations of this restriction to use and/or access Catrobat’s Software Applications and Services can be prosecuted by law and fined with the amount of 30,000.- € (amount valid in 2014; this amount is to be adjusted by the cumulated official yearly average inflation rate of the European Union), the fine having to be paid privately by each individual Responsible who is violating this restriction. The litigated amount resulting after all official administrative legal fees have been paid to the court, whatever this amount is, must be equally split between</li>
                  <ol type="i">
                    <li>the law company that won the litigation,</li>
                    <li>the Free Software Foundation or, alternatively, one of its sister organizations, and</li>
                    <li>another broadly recognized non-governmental non-profit organization actively developing free software or actively being involved in the fostering of the preservation of privacy and/or freedom (e.g., the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Wikimedia Foundation, Amnesty International, the Apache Foundation), the recipients of point (4.a.ii.) and (4.a.iii.) being chosen by the individual or organization that initiated the law suit.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <li>Nevertheless, there are four special circumstances under which Responsibles and their children under 13 years of age are allowed to use and access Catrobat’s Software Applications and Services, even when conditions described in Section 4.a would otherwise prohibit them from the usage of and access to Catrobat’s Software Applications and Services:</li>
                  <ol type="i">
                    <li>if the Responsible has publicly, i.e., in a way that has made it widely known to anyone interested in such topics, e.g., in mass media that are broadly received all over the world, believably denounced and condemned all Acts of all Entities with which the Responsible has been associated, and the Responsible has from that moment on not been associated anymore with these Entities and/or other Entities involved in and/or responsible for Acts (“whistleblower exception”), or</li>
                    <li>if all Entities with which the Responsible has been associated and that are and/or have been involved in and/or responsible for Acts, have confessed all and every of these Acts publicly, i.e., in a way that has made it widely known to anyone interested in such topics, e.g., in mass media that are broadly received all over the world, and these Entities have permanently stopped doing all and any Acts, and have destroyed all the mass surveillance data they have collected, in a permanent and complete way (“policy correction exception”), or</li>
                    <li>if the Responsible was forced to be associated with the Entity because of slavery, under duress, or through coercion (“duress exception”); note, however, that being forced or obliged to be associated with an Entity involved in and/or responsible for Acts because of legal reasons (e.g., by having to follow the law) is explicitly not to be considered as sufficient to be included in this exception, or</li>
		 <li>if the Responsible, in the following called the “Innocent”, is and/or has been associated with an Entity, in the following called the “Victim Entity”; and if one or several different Responsibles, in the following called “Rogue Associates” who are and/or were associated with the Victim Entity, are associated with a second Entity, in the following called the “Unethical Entity” ; and if anyone of the Rogue Associates is forbidden to use and/or access Catrobat's  Software Applications and Services under consideration of Sections 4.a and 4.b through his or her association with the Unethical Entity; and if the Innocent would be forbidden to use and/or access Catrobat's  Software Applications and Services under consideration of Sections 4.a and 4.b only because of the Rogue Associates; and if none of the Responsibles associated with the Victim Entity besides the Rogue Associates would be forbidden to use and/or access Catrobat's  Software Applications and Services under consideration of Sections 4.a and 4.b except because of the Rogue Associates; and if all and every other Responsibles of the Victim Entity (besides the Rogue Associates) who are not and/or have not been associated with the Unethical Entity and/or any third Entity whose associates are forbidden to use and/or access Catrobat's Software Applications and Services, are not aware of the association of the Rogue Associates with the Unethical Entity (“victim entity exception”).</li>
		 </ol>
                  <li>You are granted permission to access and use the Software Applications and Services provided Section 4.a does not apply to you, or Section 4.b does apply to you, and you agree not to use the Software Applications and Services for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain Catrobat's prior written approval:</li>
                  <ol type="i">
                    <li>the sale of the Software Applications and access to the Services;</li>
                    <li>the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Software Applications and Services or Content.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <li>You are granted permission to access and use the Software Applications and Services provided Section 4.a does not apply to you, or Section 4.b does apply to you, and you agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Services in a manner that sends more request messages to the Catrobat servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Catrobat grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Catrobat reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Software Applications and Services, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Software Applications and Services (e.g., comments, forum) for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Software Applications and Services with respect to their Content.</li>
                  <li>You are granted permission to access and use the Software Applications and Services provided Section 4.a does not apply to you, or Section 4.b does apply to you, and that in your use and access of the Software Applications and Services, you will comply with all applicable laws.</li>
                  <li>Catrobat reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Software Applications and Services at any time.</li>
                </ol>

                </ol>
                <h3>6. Your Content and Conduct</h3>
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>As a Catrobat account holder you may submit Content to the Services, including but not limited to software and user comments. You understand that Catrobat does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any Content you submit.</li>

However, by submitting Content to Catrobat Services, you hereby put this Content under the licenses detailed on <a href="http://developer.catrobat.org/licenses_of_uploaded_catrobat_programs">http://developer.catrobat.org/licenses_of_uploaded_catrobat_programs</a>, thereby granting Catrobat and each user of the Software Applications and Services a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content in connection with the Service and Catrobat's (and its successors' and affiliates') activities, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Content (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels.
