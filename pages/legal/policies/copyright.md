## Copyright Policy

Version 2.1, 13 January 2019

The Catrobat team respects the intellectual property of others, as well as of our users. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please send us an <a href="mailto:webmaster@catrobat.org?subject=Copyright policy">email</a>.

We will promptly process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0029:EN:HTML">Directive 2001/29/EC</a> and other applicable intellectual property laws. Upon receipt, the Catrobat team may act expeditiously to remove or disable access to any material claimed to be infringing. Repeat infringers of third-party copyrights are subject to termination of our services in appropriate circumstances.

In assessing whether or not a Catrobat user has violated your copyrights, please keep in mind that Catrobat is an educational and not-for-profit initiative, seeking to aid young people's learning by providing the tools for them to learn and express themselves using digital technology.

We hope you also see Catrobat not only as a good way of popularizing your creations but also as an opportunity to do something good for young people's education.

If you choose to make a copyright infringement complaint, please note that we may post your notification, with personally identifiable information redacted, to a clearinghouse such as <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/">https://lumendatabase.org/</a>. Please also note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that an activity is infringing your copyright.
