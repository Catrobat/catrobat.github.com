## Licenses of the Catrobat System

### <b>The following licenses, terms, and conditions apply to your use of the Catrobat system:</b>

Version 3.7, 13 January 2019

All source code of software constituting the Catrobat system, e.g., the integrated development environments (with all associated parts such as tutorial programs) and the interpreters and compilers for the Catrobat programming language, the image editing programs, the source code of software we wrote to run the Catrobat websites and other Internet resources, and all our own source code related to the Catrobat system, are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>: you can redistribute them and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>, either <a href="/docs/legal/licenses/agpl-v3">version 3 of the License </a>, or (at your option) any <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">later version when it becomes available</a>.

The names and logos of the Catrobat project and subprojects are copyrighted by and trademarks of the Catrobat project and cannot be used in derivative work. You are however allowed to use the names and logos of Catrobat, Catroid, Catty, Pocket Code, Paintroid, Pocket Paint, and other names and logos of software created by the Catrobat team in non-derivative work such as, e.g., books, brochures, or descriptive web pages. We do ask to include a note that either says "Catrobat is developed by the free/libre open source non-profit Catrobat project <a href="https://www.catrobat.org/">https://www.catrobat.org/</a>" or "Catrobat makes it easy to create your own interactive stories, games, and animations --- and share your creations with others. As you create and share Catrobat projects, you learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. All parts of the Catrobat system are developed by the free/libre open source non-profit Catrobat project <a href="https://www.catrobat.org/">https://www.catrobat.org/</a>. They are available as free/libre open source software on <a href="https://github.com/Catrobat/">GitHub</a>".

For the parts of the Catrobat system necessary for running a Catrobat program, e.g., the interpreters, the GNU Affero General Public License is supplemented by an <a href="/pages/legal/licenses/additional-terms">additional permission under section 7 of version 3 of the License</a>. This exception allows you to convey a runtime version of a program or project written in the Catrobat programming language, for which you otherwise legally hold the necessary rights, in combination with the parts of the Catrobat system necessary for running that Catrobat program, under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the independent parts of the corresponding Catrobat program.

Please note that this is only possible either when you are the sole creator of the program including all its parts such as graphics, texts, sounds, etc, or in case you licensed the parts of other programs on which your program is based upon, including any additional material and/or possible trademarks etc, in such a way that you are allowed to convey the resulting software under your chosen terms in consistence with these third-party materials. This additional permission is similar to the additional permission for GCC (see the corresponding <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception-3.1-faq.html">Rationale and FAQ page for the exception for GCC</a> for more information). If the work thus created has an interactive user interface, it must display a note in a screen shown when the user presses an "About" menu button or a similar way to convey such a message that says "This work was created using programs developed by the free/libre open source non-profit Catrobat project. Catrobat makes it easy to create your own interactive stories, games, and animations --- and share your creations with others. As you create and share Catrobat projects, you learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Catrobat is available as free/libre open source software on <a href="https://github.com/Catrobat/">GitHub</a> and is distributed by the Catrobat project under the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>, either <a href="/docs/legal/licenses/agpl-v3">version 3 of the License </a>, or (at your option) any <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">later version when it becomes available</a>. For the parts of the Catrobat system necessary for running a Catrobat program (also called Catrobat "projects" created by our users), e.g., the Catrobat Interpreter, the GNU Affero General Public License is supplemented by an additional permission under section 7 of <a href="/pages/legal/licenses/agpl-v3">version 3 of the License</a>. This exception allows to convey a runtime version of a Catrobat program, for which you otherwise legally hold the necessary rights, in combination with the parts of the Catrobat system necessary for running that Catrobat program, under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the independent parts of the corresponding Catrobat program.". The same notice must also be added by you as text in or along any documents you distribute together with your runtime version of the program. Please consult our <a href="/pages/legal/licenses/additional-term">Catrobat License Additional Term page </a> for the precise legal formulation of the additional permission under section 7 of version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. For clarification, note that this additional permission does not apply to projects you upload to Catrobat's website. Please consult our <a href="/pages/legal/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use and Service</a> and our <a href="/pages/legal/licenses/uploaded-catrobat-programs">Licenses of uploaded Catrobat projects </a> for the precise legal terms and conditions that apply to a project you upload to Catrobat's sharing site.

Please also note that by using or visiting any website (including any software that we created which either runs directly on our servers, or alternatively runs client-side, e.g., in your browser, but is served by our servers) or products (including all our online services provided by software that we created which are offered through our servers), all executables we offer on any markets or the web (including, e.g., the Google Play App Store, Apple's iTunes App Store, Amazon's App Store, etc), data feeds, and services provided to you on, from, or through the Catrobat project (collectively the "Service"), you signify your agreement to (1) Catrobat's terms and conditions (the "Terms of Use and Service", found at <a href="https://catrob.at/touas">https://catrob.at/touas</a>), (2) Catrobat's privacy notice (found at https://catrob.at/privacypolicy), and (3) Catrobat's Community Guidelines (found at https://catrob.at/tou). If you do not agree to any of these terms, the Catrobat privacy notice, or the Community Guidelines, please do not use the Service.

All non-software artefacts of the Catrobat system created by us, such as, e.g., text, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features, and other materials are available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (CC BY-SA 4.0), the only exceptions being the names and logos of the Catrobat project (including, e.g., Catrobat, Catroid, Catty, Pocket Code, Paintroid, Pocket Paint), which are copyrighted by and trademarks of the Catrobat project and cannot be used in derivative work. See <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/</a> for a human-readable summary of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License.
