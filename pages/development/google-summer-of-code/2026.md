# Ideas Page for Google Summer of Code 2026
{: .no_toc }

We are thrilled to share our carefully curated project ideas for this year's Google Summer of Code.

## General Information
{: .no_toc }

These ideas are just some topics we came up with, where currently nobody is working on. However, Catrobat is a project with a wide range of possibilities and we're aware of our blindspots: So let's live the spirit of Open Source and come up with improvements (e.g., new features, extensions, ...) that are related to the project and in which you're interested in. We do have many senior contributors who would be happy to mentor such a project. Don't be shy and check out the last point on the list: Your idea!

## General Knowledge Prerequisites for all Projects
{: .no_toc }

- Usage of Git and GitHub
- Software testing (e.g., test doubles) and test-driven development
- Kotlin or Flutter for Android ideas
- Swift for iOS ideas
- Also please check that you have the proper hardware for the development (e.g., an Android/iOS smartphone for testing some of the projects, Mac for iOS development etc)

### Multiplayer, IoT, and Home Assistant support via two MQTT bricks

90, 175 or 350 hours
{: .label .label-blue }

{: .highlight  }
> **Required Skills**: Kotlin, Android-Development, Agile Development, Test Driven Development, Clean Code<br>
> **Possible Mentors**: Wolfgang Slany, XXXXX <br>
> **Expected Outcome**: Two new bricks for sending and receiving MQTT messages<br>
> **Difficulty level**: Advanced 

Implement MQTT support for the Catrobat language in Catroid (Pocket Code and its flavors) so Catrobat programs can publish/receive network messages for multiplayer games, IoT, and Home Assistant setups. Add two new Catrobat bricks (activated via app settings):
- Broadcast … via MQTT on channel …
- When you receive a message via MQTT on channel … store it in …

Broker/TLS/auth/client-id are configured globally in app settings, and connect/subscribe happen lazily to avoid boilerplate (wildcard channels should store channel+message as JSON). Provide example projects for two multiplayer architectures:
- one phone acting as a local hub (extending the existing Bluetooth multiplayer variables concept) and
- a dedicated hub over local Wi-Fi (e.g., Mosquitto) coordinating multiple players. Also provide a Home Assistant-oriented topic convention under catrobat/... enabling wall-tablet dashboards and home automations (Tuya/Smart Life and other Home Assistant-supported hardware).

Ensure rock-solid reliability (reconnect/offline handling) and strong automated tests for core logic (especially topic-filter matching and message routing). Interested applicants should contact Wolfgang Slany early (as soon as possible) for additional applicant instructions, test-ticket, and expectations.

{: .highlight  }
> **Required Skills**: Flutter, Dart, Android-Development, Agile Development <br>
> **Possible Mentors**: Abdulbaki Celebi, Mario Kaurin, Julia Herold, Thorsten Bandel <br>
> **Expected Outcome**: Features from Kotlin/Java version of Paintroid ported to new Flutter-based version<br>
> **Difficulty level**: Medium to advanced 

The developer should have knowledge of Flutter. Develop and implement missing tools in Flutter that exist in our old Android app built with Android Native.

### AI Mentor for PocketCode Students
350 Hours
{: .label .label-blue }

{: .highlight  }
> **Required Skills**: Kotlin, Python, Android AI and ML Tools, Android-Development, Agile Development, Test Driven Development, Clean Code<br>
> **Possible Mentors**: Paul Spiesberger, Patrick Ratschiller <br>
> **Expected Outcome**: An integrated proof of concept AI mentor within PocketCode <br>
> **Difficulty level**: Advanced 

AI is now capable of sophisticated programming and can automate many coding tasks. More importantly, it excels at explaining code to students, making learning more engaging and accessible. Our goal is to integrate an AI-powered mentor into PocketCode that understands a student’s programming context and offers real-time guidance to enhance learning and coding skills.

The AI mentor could:
- Explain programming concepts, from variables and loops to software design patterns and testing strategies
- Suggest code from text prompts, help debug issues, and propose project ideas
- Assist in code architecture, naming conventions, and writing Catrobat language tests
- Explain and translate downloaded projects from other users

You won’t need to implement everything—just focus on a part that excites you most! The Catrobat team will provide the initial prompt and necessary API access or local LLMs for support.

> **Difficulty level**: Medium 

This year's focus of Catrobat includes topics around marine biology as an application area, and we have several projects around the general topic. This project will focus on developing AI-powered 3D models of marine species using generative AI techniques. By training machine learning models on marine biology datasets, realistic and interactive 3D assets of octopus, fish, corals, and other underwater species will be created for use in AR applications for teaching marine biology in high schools, where teachers and pupils will be able to “program” the simulated marine animals for learning purposes integrated into biology curricula. These models will adapt dynamically based on environmental conditions like depth, temperature, and biodiversity levels.

### Awesome Demo Game Project on Marine Biology
350 Hours
{: .label .label-blue }

{: .highlight  }
> **Required Skills**: Coding Basics<br>
> **Possible Mentors**: Selina Ernst, Wolfgang Slany <br>
> **Expected Outcome**: Catrobat Demo Game on Marine Biology <br>
> **Difficulty level**: Beginner 

Spend the whole GSoC time developing and designing a demo game. This year's focus of Catrobat includes topics around marine biology as an application area, and we have several projects around the general topic. The present project aims at inspiring young people to become aware of topics related to the protection of marine habits by creating related video games of their own. If you have your own original idea about a game around this topic, please feel free to suggest it. Please note that the demo game will be published under Catrobat’s free open source license, and that the game will thus become part of the Catrobat FLOSS project’s source code. Thus, all artwork, sounds, character names etc must be compatible with our licenses, i.e., freely publishable under our licenses, the AGPL version 3 and CC BY-SA 4.0, or under a compatible, possibly even freer license such as CC0.

In the last years we found that you have many great ideas and knowledge! We're aware that there are many ways how to improve performance, reduce memory usage, make our services more stable and of course the code easier to maintain. We're sure you do have ideas how to achieve this, although we may have never heard of this approach before -> that's the great thing about Open Source! And well, that's also the experience we made at last year's GSoC - and we liked it!

Also new features or extensions for iOS and Android are welcome to be introduced to us. Help us to spread coding and Open Source!
