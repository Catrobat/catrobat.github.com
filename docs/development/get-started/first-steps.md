## Your first steps into Catrobat

The following lines should help you with your first steps into the Catrobat project.

1. Write some programs using Pocket Code and Pocket Paint, upload your Catrobat programs and check out our inspiration source, the Scratch project.
2. Visit us on GitHub - As you can see, Catrobat is an extensive project with a lot of sub-teams. So go ahead and look into them. Each project should have a readme file, so check that out too. There should be viable information for you in it.
3. If you want to contribute to our project, please choose one of the sub-projects you want to work on with us.
4. Once you have selected a project, check it out and play around with it.
5. You might find a bug while trying out Catrobat. Awesome. Report it via GitHub. If you canâ€™t find a bug, it doesnâ€™t matter; it seems that we have done too much the right way ;)
6. Now is the right time to check out the Issues on GitHub. First, fork the project, then choose an Issue you can fix, but write a regression test for it first, and only then fix it.

We strictly use Test-Driven Development and Clean Code (by Robert C. Martin). Read everything you can about these development methods. Code developed in a different style will not be accepted.

### Pull Request Review

- Have you fixed an Issue and written **at least one** test for it?
- Hopefully the pipeline does also pass **without errors**?

ðŸ¤ž Awesome!

Open a new pull request via GitHub.
It could take time until you hear from us. In the meanwhile, why don't you choose another Issue?

- Has your pull request been accepted? Go back to 6.
- Are there no more Issues? It can't be! Go back to 5.
