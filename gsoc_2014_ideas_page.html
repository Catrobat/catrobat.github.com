					<h3> Projects </h3>

					<a id="history"><strong>Title:</strong> Add a (time capsule like) history to Catroid</a>
					<br />
					<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					At first we want you to add simple undo / redo functionality into Catroid.
					This basically means that user mistakes in the scripts, sounds, costumes shall be un- or re-doable.
					Imagine it like a typical Undo/Redo Button you find in nearly all of your IDEs.

				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC undo and redo should be fully implemented,
					tested and *INTEGRATED* into the Pocket Code master branch.

				<a id="converter"><strong>Title:</strong> Scratch to Catrobat converter</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					Extend and update our converter
					for [http://scratch.mit.edu/ Scratch] Programs to Catrobat programs. This involves, but is not limited to, decoding
					the projects from Scratch, converting them to Catrobat programs, and automating the process. Our existing code base for this project,
					which already contains much of the needed functionality, can be found on https://github.com/Catrobat/ScratchToCatrobat

					Note that keyboard events are translated into new "key" objects, with all "When key XXX pressed" event bricks replaced
					by a small script in this new object that shows the corresponding image of the key on the screen at some appropriate place, and which has a
					"When tapped" script that sends a 'XXX-key pressed' broadcast message. Where the original key bricks were in the Scratch program,
					a "When 'XXX-key pressed' broadcast message is received" brick is automatically inserted. Kids can then change this
					manually to something more appropriate on a smartphone or tablet, e.g., by using the inclination sensors. This also
					works already but must be made more beautiful and intelligent.

					All Scratch blocks not yet implemented in Catrobat need to be translated into comments that show all relevant content and parameters.
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					You get a Scratch Program from [http://scratch.mit.edu/ here] and convert it
					into a Catrobat Program so that it can be played and edited in Pocket Code. There must be an interface in
					the administration section of our web interface to initiate this process. Such a web interface already exists
					in a rudimentary form. The project must be fully implemented, tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the
					ScratchToCatrobat repository on github.
				</p>

				<a id="list"><strong>Title:</strong> List support in Formula Editor</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					Lists should be implemented in the Formula Editor.
					Listelements can be any kind of Formula (NUMBERS, STRINGS, SENSORS, nested LISTS)
					Implementation of the following functionality is required:
					* Creation of a list ( listname, Scope: for all or this object only ).
					* Add an item to a list.
					* Delete first, last or all item of a list.
					* Insert an item at first, last or random position in a list.
					* Replace an item ( first, last or random ) with a new item in a list.
					* Return an item at first, last or random position in a list.
					* Length of a list. (Number of items in a list)
					* Does a list contain a certain value? (Boolean function)

					Optional functionality:
					* Displaying of lists on stage. (listname, listindex, interpretation of listitem, length of list)
					* Show list on stage brick.
					* Hide list on stage brick.
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the Pocket Code master branch.

				<a id="apk"><strong>Title:</strong> APK Generator</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					It should be possible to create Android apk's out of Pocket Code programs. There is already a demonstrative standalone version
					of the Tic-Tac-Toe-Program on Google Play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.catrobat.catroid.standalone.tictactoe_master )
					with > 5000 Downloads. This was implemented in a separate branch (https://github.com/Catrobat/Catroid/tree/TicTacToe). With this GSoC-Project
					it should be possible to create an apk out of any uploaded Catrobat program (e.g., by offering a menu "convert to apk" in the admin section of our website).
					As a next step, it should be possible to upload the created apk on our Server (e.g. Jenkins) for manual approvement or for uploading
					it manually on Google Play. It would be nice if there is also an admin interface on the server to manage the apk's.
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the appropriate master branches.
				</p>
				<strong>Mentor:</strong><i> Anton Rieder or Stefan Jaindl</i>
				<br />
				<hr>

				<a id="images"><strong>Title:</strong> Search for Images</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					It should be possible to add images (and potentially sounds) by mining CC-SA-BY media content (creative commons).
					This is content that can be used when the license and author are given attribution. Touchdevelop by implements a similar
					functionality (https://www.touchdevelop.com/ ). As a first step the content should be searchable and insertable only from local
					Pocket Code programs on the file system and the Pocket Code server. New xml entries are required for each media file. The entries should contain licenses
					including the original author, plus any other meta information, e.g., a link to the place where and when the files were found on
					the web or at some other place, and any other information, e.g., keywords or tags etc. Optionally, credits might be given in
					textual form (as another xml entry), both for single media files as well as for whole Catrobat programs. This project may be realized as a Web API.

					As a next step it would be nice to search on Scratch, Touch-develop, Google Image - but this is not a
					requirement, it is nice to have.
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the appropriate master branches.

				<a id="cloning"><strong>Title:</strong> Cloning Bricks</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					Cloning in Scratch 2.0 is a feature that allows a sprite to create a clone, or duplicate, of itself, while the project is running.
					This can be useful in tower defense games, for example, for a wave of objects. Clones of a sprite will be the same as the original,
					or parent sprite, but as a separate instance (see http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Cloning). 3 additional bricks are required -
					these bricks are "create a clone", "delete clone" and as script brick "when I start as clone", just like in Scratch.
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the Pocket Code master branch.
				</p>
				<strong>Mentor:</strong><i> Stefan Simon</i>
				<br />
				<hr>

				<a id="featurecomplete"><strong>Title:</strong> Make Pocket Code Bricks feature-complete to Scratch</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					Pocket Code is missing the popular show/hide variable as well as pen bricks from Scratch. The aim of this project is to implement these missing bricks.

					Show and hide variable bricks are needed in Pocket Code programs. They are necessary to display, e.g., game statistics.
					See http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Show_Variable_()_(block) .
					The Show Variable () block is a Variables block and a Stack block. The block shows the specified variable's Stage monitor.
					In projects that use variables' Stage monitors to display things, the displays may have to hide and show at times; this can be done
					with the Hide Variable () brick.

					Pen blocks in Scratch 2.0 are used to draw something on the screen, much like in Turtle graphics. There are
					eleven bricks in this category. Pen bricks allow to take various actions:
					- Stamp the sprite
					- Put the pen down
					- Release the pen
					One example of a one sprite one script project is a simple drawing program.
					See http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Pen_Blocks
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the Pocket Code master branch.

				<hr>

				<a id="overview"><strong>Title:</strong> Object Overview Screen</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					It should be possible to get an attractive overview over the objects of a program. It should be a bit like
					with HTC Sense's home screen, see <a href="http://youtu.be/zgRGwdcx42I?t=1m25s">this YouTube link for a video of the animation type</a>.
					First, it should be only for objects (image of object and possibly the name). On click on an image, the program menu
					of the respective object should be opened.

					As a nice to have, if time permits this could also be implemented for scripts.
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the Pocket Code master branch.
				</p>
				<strong>Mentor:</strong><i> Annemarie Harzl</i>
				<br />
				<hr>

				<a id="youtube"><strong>Title:</strong> Youtube-Recorder and -Uploader</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					Our Youtube-Recorder and -Uploader must be brought up-to-date and integrated into Pocket Code.
					It should also be integrated in the Pocket Code Website. This was already working in 2012, but must be
					adapted to today's code base. Test-Videos recorded directly from the stage can be found on
					http://www.youtube.com/user/testlexmiir/videos
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon features must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the Catroweb master branch.
				</p>
				<strong>Mentor:</strong><i> Stefan Simon or Wolfgang Slany</i>
				<br />
				<hr>

				<a id="enhancement"><strong>Title:</strong> Brick/script display enhancement</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					NestingBricks (loops and if-bricks) and Scripts are currently visually separated from the
					bricks nested within them.
					There should be an option that allows to see the connection between them, like in Scrath. This includes variable width,
					automatic wrap around, and wide screen Scratch-like enclosures (connecting branch on the left side, between
					matching parts (multi-brick commands)
					- see e.g. the forever brick in this link: http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Show_Variable_()_(block).

					Nice to have: Also provide pinch/zoom overview
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the Pocket Code master branch.
				</p>
				<strong>Mentor:</strong><i> Stefan Simon</i>
				<br />
				<hr>

				<a id="reorderable"><strong>Title:</strong> ReorderableListBox</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					Provide a listbox with the ability to reorder items per drag and drop with fancy animations.
					The items will be build generic and containing different Catrobat controls like lables, textboxes, dropdown-fields, etc.
					The Listbox will be used also for the scripts (the items will be docked to next/previous). It will be used in nearly every part of the WindowsPhone-Catrobat.
					The Final-ListBox will be highly dynamic and easily adoptable to all the different Catrobat needs.

					Nice to have: Also provide pinch/zoom functions to the listbox, to show different Lists on one screen.
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the Windows Phone master branch.
				</p>
				<strong>Mentor:</strong><i> Annemarie Harzl</i>
				<br />
				<hr>

				<a id="backpack"><strong>Title:</strong> Backpack for Bricks</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					In one of the GSoC 2013 projects a backpack, which is a temporary storage for images and sounds, was implemented - just as in Scratch.
					With the backpack it is possible to cut/copy/move those items across programs within Pocket Code.
					The aim of this project is to provide the same functionality for scripts - with support of our Usability team.
					It should be possible to move whole scripts as well as coherent bricks to the backpack.
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the Pocket Code master branch.
				</p>
				<strong>Mentor:</strong><i> Stefan Jaindl</i>
				<br />
				<hr>

				<a id="recommender"><strong>Title:</strong> Recommender and Social Sharing</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					Integrate social sharing functionality into the pocketcode.org
					website for Catrobat programs and into all PocketCode Mobile Apps, so users are
					able to like, recommend their favorite PocketCode programs, and share their
					thoughts with their friends from other social networks. Enable login via Facebook,
					Twitter, or Google account. Provide a new section "Most popular programs" on
					pocketcode.org.

					Integrate recommendation list of other relevant programs into the program detail page.
					This list should contain other popular programs that were downloaded by users that
					have installed the currently viewed program too.
					("users who installed this program, installed these programs too")

					The project code should be integrated into the pocketcode.org site, thus technical
					requirements are the same as for the pocketcode.org site (PHP5).
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					The project should provide us more information about our
					users and the ability to detect relations between popular programs.
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the master branch.

				<a id="guitar"><strong>Title:</strong> Musicdroid - Guitar</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					Create the new Instrument Guitar for Musicdroid. This should contain
					the User-Interface and the translation into our already available business-logic for midi-files.
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					The project should give us the possibility to accompany our piano-melodies with
					guitar accords. It would also be nice if we could play a simple melody with the guitar.

					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the master branch.
				</p>
				<strong>Mentor:</strong><i> Bianca Teufl</i>

				<a id="singing"><strong>Title:</strong> Musicdroid - Convert singing to notes</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					Musicdroid should have the possibility to convert the singing of the user
					into notes which could be represented by Musicdroid's note drawing.
					The approach is available but there has to be some experience in audio engineering.
					The code should be included into the Musicdroid project.
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					The project should give us the possibility to convert the singin of the user
					into a midi-melody which can be represented as a midi track with different instruments.

					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the master branch.

				<a id="collision"><strong>Title:</strong> Collision filtering in PhysicEngine</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					Use libgdx-wrapper-methods of box2D to provide collision filtering in Pocket Code.
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					let's take an example: we have three kinds of objects
					in a simple game: players, monsters, and scenery.
					We can implement rules like: players should not collide with each others,
					neither do monsters, but players should collide with monsters (and vice-versa).
					And both have to collide with the scenery.

					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the master branch.

				<a id="vision"><strong>Title:</strong> Computer Vision Enhancement</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					Add computer vision features. Currently working is face localization. We want more, e.g.,
					movement recognition such as in Scratch 2.0 video blocks, but possibly even further, such
					as kinect type gesture recognition of finger, hand, or arm movements, and possible also
					object learning and recognition (2D, or even 3D).
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the master branch.

				<a id="#userbricks"><strong>Title:</strong> Global User-Defined Bricks</a>
				<br />
				<strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
				<p>
					Currently (in the version from a GSoC 2013 project) the
					user-defined bricks are always local to one object. The aim of the new
					GSoC project would be to extend this functionality to user-defined
					bricks that are global to a Catrobat program. Additionally,
					copy/cut/pasting should also be supported in all possible ways, e.g.,
					to make a duplicate of a local or global user-created brick, or copy a
					local one and paste it into another object. Also, when copying
					objects, any local user-defined bricks should also be copied, and when
					copying scripts any user-defined bricks that were used in the scripts 
					should also be included in the copy.
				</p>
				<strong>Expected results:</strong>
				<p>
					This task is split up from the mentor so that you will always have to implement
					one small task after the other. At the end of GSoC, the agreed-upon functionality must be fully implemented,
					tested, and *INTEGRATED* into the master branch.
