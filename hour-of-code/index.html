       <h2>First steps and rules</h2>
         <p>First, let’s have a look at the <a href="https://share.catrob.at/pocketcode/pocket-library/looks">media library</a> in which we provided some awesome graphics for you.
           You can use them to make your project more colorful and they will give you some good ideas for your app.
           Of course you can draw your own images or use looks you find in other Catrobat projects. You also may use third-party graphics, but please respect copyrights and licenses. Same also for sounds and music.</p>
         <p>After having a look at our media gallery you will need an idea. You will have to think about what kind of project (game, animation, etc.) you want to create,
           and try to relate it to the theme of Heroes of the Universe. You might even already have some great ideas after having a look at the media assets.
         </p>
           <p>In order to make your app even more interesting you can implement some of the following features (they are optional, and not all will fit to every project):
<br>
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; A welcome screen
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; A short description
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; A "You have won!" screen
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; A game-over screen
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; Sounds or music
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; Sensors
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; A second level
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; Collisions
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; A foreign language

          <h3>What media content can I use?</h3>
          <p>We don't want to limit your creativity in any way,
            hence there are no requirements by us. However, please respect the copyrights
            of others and don't use any media content without permission.
          You can find a lot of great media assets available under Creative Commons
          Licenses in other projects on our community site which you can all freely use,
          or you can go to a public site that offers such content, e.g.,
          on <a target="_blank" href="https://search.creativecommons.org/">search.creativecommons.org</a>.</p>

            as they are correctly attributed and are published under the same licenses.</p>

          <p>Please just follow the instructions <a href="#about">above</a>. That's it!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column">
          <h3>How can I submit my project?</h3>
          <p>To submit your project just upload it as usual and do not forget to include the hashtag #hotu so we are able to find your project!</p>

          <h3>What's going to happen after I've submitted my project?</h3>
          <p>After the submission process you can find your project on our <a target="_blank" href="https://share.catrob.at/pocketcode/">share platform</a>,

          <h3>Are there any prizes involved?</h3>
          <p>The greatest prize there is are the friends we make and the knowledge we gain along the way!</p>
          <p>Through your participation, you have already gained knowledge and new skills that can
            be worth an infinite amount of money in your future life. Know that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg,
            Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk all started by creating small games while they were teenagers.
            We do not offer rewards or prizes for the Heroes of the Universe Game Jam, as that would
            defeat its purpose since we cannot give material prizes to everyone --- instead, the
            satisfaction of having created something awesome by yourself, for your friends and
            family, as well as for the world at large, is the greatest reward you can give yourself.</p>

          <h3>Can I participate together with my friends? Or can I participate with my class?</h3>
